Example
-------

Hereâ€™s an example of the tool usage, with the variables tas, prc, and
rlut. The time-series files containing the regridded output are in a
directory named input_path, and a directory named output_path will be
used to hold the CMIP6 output.

::

   e3sm_to_cmip -v tas, prc, rlut --realm atm --input ./input_path/ --output ./output_path/ -t ~/cmip6-cmor-tables -u e3sm_user_config_picontrol.json

This will produce a directory tree named CMIP6 below the output_path,
with the CMIP6 directory tree based on the metadata json file.
